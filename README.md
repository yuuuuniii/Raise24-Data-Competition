## 🎯Problem Statement
The relationship between the media and public perception is symbiotic, with each influencing the other. The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has sparked diverse reactions across various sectors. Understanding the narratives in the media and their consequent impact on public perception is crucial. While recent research has highlighted the media's influence, there has been a lack of comprehensive analysis regarding the evolution of emotional and sentiment trends within AI-related reporting over time.

## 🎯Goal
Our objective is to investigate whether the media perpetuates fear of AI. By analyzing 10,000 news headlines, we employ advanced sentiment analysis and emotion detection models. We leverage natural language processing (NLP) methods and machine learning (ML) models such as BART-large-mnli and Emotion-English-DistilRoBERTa-base. Through this analysis, we aim to uncover the nuances of AI-related news framing and explore the societal impact of news headlines.
